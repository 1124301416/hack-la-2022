My name is Lucas and I am a second-year stat student. I have never been to a Hackathon before so I would like to know how I can prepare for Saturday.
 
Thanks",,2022-11-01T16:49:50Z
5962353,5962021,General Hackathon Questions,"Any questions about the hackathon that we haven't answered, ask here!","Hi Lucas, 
First, it will be best to find a team if you don't have one, on Saturday we hope to have participants get started - so there may not be too much time to find a team to join. You can think about what skills you have to bring to a hackathon, and what you may need support from a team for - this can help you decide what kind of project you will complete: building a product, doing some exploration and/or analysis, data visualization etc. 
Second, you might want to explore git/GitHub if you haven't already. This is the platform we are hoping that student teams use to share their final products. 
Third, keep your eye out in this course - we hope to release the data (or a sample) soon. You can start exploring / thinking of questions / brainstorming what you might want to build or analyze. We will be working with a subset/transformed version of 'Navigation Events'. https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.data_service_caliper_navigation_events.html 
Best,

I'm Alison, one of the organizers of the hackathon.
I am a research analyst at UBC Sauder where I help to explore, analyze, and understand data that can support our faculty in their teaching practice. The data we will be sharing in this hackathon is the kind of data I would use to help inform an instructor about their course and assessment design - so I am looking forward to seeing what you would ask of the data or create with it. 
My analytics toolkit involves Python, Jupyter notebooks for cleaning, exploration, and documentation, and Tableau for data visualization.  
I am looking forward to learning more about you and your teams. I'm also happy to answer any questions here or via email (alison.myers@sauder.ubc.ca). ",1,2022-11-01T00:43:09Z

I work on the Learning Analytics team at the Centre for Teaching, Learning and Technology (CTLT), where I build and maintain the distributed cloud infrastructure for collecting and storing learning data generated by the online learning technology systems at UBC.
